# chordmap
ChordMaps are a visual way of representing the chord progressions of songs using a circular diagram. They are based on the concept of Roman numeral analysis, which assigns a number to each chord in a key according to its scale degree. For example, in the key of C major, the chord C is I, the chord Dm is ii, the chord Em is iii, and so on. ChordMaps show these Roman numerals along with the chord type (major, minor, diminished, etc.) in a circle that corresponds to the 12 possible keys. By rotating the circle, one can easily transpose a song to a different key or compare songs in different keys. ChordMaps also show the common patterns and relationships among chords, such as the circle of fifths, the diatonic chords, and the secondary dominants1. Chase charts are a useful tool for songwriters, performers, and music students who want to learn and understand the music theory of songs.
