## Project 2: chordnotestoromannumeral
In project 2, the output JSON file generated in project 1 is read. In the first analysis step, the key of each section is determined. Then, each chord note is assigned to Roman numerals in the corresponding keys. The chord names and notes are converted enharmonically correctly into the key. An output JSON file containing the analysis results is generated.
